 Video Interpreter Software Demo

Download all of these files, (no need to download the README file) slap them in one directory, then double click
the Video Interpreter executable file (Video_Interpreter.exe) to gain a full experience of Video Interpreter

Make sure you are working on Windows, and it's important that you unzip the 'opencv_world320d.zip' file
to get the 'opencv_world320d.dll' file. (Git Hub wouldn't allow me to include the original file unzipped, apparently its
too big, so kindly right-click and unzip it before attempting to run the software :-D)

P.S. Also check out the addendum, because I had trouble re-downloading the xml files
